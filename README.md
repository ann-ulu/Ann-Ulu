## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ann Ulu, Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸŒŸ

I am a data analyst who leverages the power of data to drive innovation and solve real-world problems. I'm also enthusiastic about machine learning and its potential to transform the way we utilize information. When I'm not building predictive models, creating dashboards, or writing scripts, you'll find me on Medium, where I share insights and knowledge about data and technology.
